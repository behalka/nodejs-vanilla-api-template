# STRV vanilla API template

## What's the goal here

- to try to explore the options of pure Javascript
- to try to leverage simple composition patterns over OOP
- to build a minimal API skeleton with as little magic as possible
  - with GraphQL server
  - without decorators
  - with the most transparent ORM I know of - Objection.js

## TODO - functionality

- simple 3-entities example (User, Event, Tag)
- fancy tags search to test ORM capabilities
- Nexus/Objection.js implementation
- generic pagination
- efficient DB/Repository mocks -> paralel tests
